# About this branch
This branch adds 3 new pockets to the bag based on changes to it from later generations:
* Medicine (HP, PP and status recovery items)
* Power-Up (Vitamins and evolution items)
* Battle Items (X items, Pokédoll/FluffyTail and hold items with battle effects)

The new order for the pockets is the following:
* Items
* Medicine
* Poké Balls
* Battle Items
* Berries
* Power-Up
* TMs & HMs
* Key Items

However, it reuses the original pocket sprites until I'm able to get new ones for the new pockets.

To-Do:
* New bag sprites.

# Aeiry's Pokémon Emerald

This is a (currently personal) fork of [**pret/pokeemerald**](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald)

I have little knowledge of C or assembly, so this will preliminarily be a place that I try to jam other people's code/branches into my own fork, and then try to make it work.

Super far flung goal would be to implement a series of changes in a speedchoice-esque way, but I'm not sure if that's even possible for some of the things I want to do.

Wishlist:

* Most/all of the features in [**speedchoice**](https://github.com/ProjectRevoTPP/pokeemerald-speedchoice), but with the ability to toggle more of them on/off either at will or when creating a new game.
* Auto-Run when B not pressed
* Auto advance text when a button not pressed (ideally like speedchoice but as if you're always holding a button)
* Bag sorting, either automatically or using a button
* Toggle to remove "useless" npcs (e.g. any npc that only has dialogue and nothing else)
* Toggle to show hidden items on the overworld
* Toggle physical/special split
